## About Me

Hello! I am Me Toufick Shaikh, a passionate web developer and the developer of Picosack, a lightweight web server for ESP8266-based IoT devices. Currently, I am studying in 12th standard at Madarsa I Azam, Mount Road.

## My Journey in Web Development

My journey in web development began when I discovered my fascination for creating interactive and user-friendly websites. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my early years in school, and the excitement of building things on the web kept me motivated to dive deeper into the world of web development.

As I honed my skills, I started exploring backend development, databases, and server-side technologies, making me realize the vast potential of the web as a platform for innovation and communication.

## Developing Picosack

During my journey as a web developer, I encountered the challenge of hosting web servers on small IoT devices. This led me to develop Picosack, a portable web server specifically designed for the ESP8266 microcontroller. Picosack aims to simplify web hosting on resource-constrained devices and empower IoT enthusiasts to build robust and efficient web-enabled applications.

## My Goals

As a web developer and student, my goals are to continue growing and contributing to the web development community. I am determined to expand Picosack's functionalities, enhance its security features, and ensure its compatibility with various microcontrollers.
